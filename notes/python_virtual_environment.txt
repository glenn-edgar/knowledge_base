Creating a Python Virtual Environment in Linux
1. Install Python and venv
First, make sure Python is installed on your system. Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed, but you may need to install the venv module:
bash# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install python3 python3-venv

# For Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S python python-virtualenv
2. Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment:
bash# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv
Replace "myenv" with whatever name you want to give your virtual environment.
3. Activate the Virtual Environment
To start using the virtual environment, you need to activate it:
bashsource myenv/bin/activate
After activation, your command prompt will change to show the name of the active environment.
4. Install Packages in Your Virtual Environment
Once activated, you can install packages that will be isolated to this environment:
bashpip install package-name
5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When you're done working, you can deactivate the environment:
bashdeactivate
6. Managing Requirements
To save your project dependencies for sharing or future installations:
bashpip freeze > requirements.txt
To install packages from a requirements file:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
