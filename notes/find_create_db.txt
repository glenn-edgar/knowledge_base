By default, when you install PostgreSQL, it creates several default databases:

postgres - This is the main default database that is created during initialization of the PostgreSQL database cluster. It's intended to be a default database for users and utilities to connect to.
template0 - This is a pristine template database that should never be changed. It's used when you want to create a new database with none of the local customizations that might have been added to template1.
template1 - This is the default template for new databases. When you create a new database without specifying a template, PostgreSQL will copy template1.


Find existing databases
Using SQL Query
You can also use an SQL query to list databases:
sql   
SELECT datname FROM pg_database;

To create a database

sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;


To check database version
sql
SELECT version();
