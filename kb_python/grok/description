have a knowledge base with the following Postgres table.  

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS knowledge_base;
            CREATE TABLE knowledge_base.knowledge_base (
                id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                label VARCHAR NOT NULL,
                name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
                properties JSON,
                data JSON,
                path LTREE UNIQUE

the path which is an ltree extension represents the hiearachy of the tree

I wan to extend my knowledge base where I can link common subgraphs into the system

The subgraphs will be identical table to the main knowledge base table.

I need a dictionary to keep track of main table and subtrees

I need a unified search strategy for traversing the knowledge graph including search through subgraphs

The label and name represent a pattern from Neo4j where label is the link and name is the node name

The current search stragey is to select a set of set and type operations using the following operation

label
name
property value  key:value
ltree  using postgres * and @ operators

generated a new modified knowledge based table as well a new search operators to bridge sub graphs

Expand for details
To extend your existing knowledge base in Postgres to include subgraphs, link them to the main table, and provide a unified search strategy, I’ll outline a solution that modifies the table structure, introduces a dictionary for tracking subgraphs, and extends the search capabilities. Below is a detailed approach:

Step 1: Modified Knowledge Base Table
The original table knowledge_base.knowledge_base uses an LTREE column (path) to represent a tree hierarchy. To incorporate subgraphs (which are identical in structure to the main table) and allow linking between them, we’ll add two columns:

subgraph_id: Identifies which subgraph a node belongs to (e.g., 0 for the main knowledge base, 1+ for subgraphs).
linked_subgraph_id: Links a node to the root of another subgraph, enabling traversal across subgraphs.
Here’s the updated table definition:

create_knowledge_base.sql
sql
Show inline
subgraph_id: Ensures each node is associated with a specific subgraph. The main knowledge base can use subgraph_id = 0.
linked_subgraph_id: If not NULL, indicates a link to the root node (assumed to have path = 'root') of the specified subgraph.
UNIQUE (subgraph_id, path): Maintains the hierarchy’s uniqueness within each subgraph.
Step 2: Dictionary for Tracking Subgraphs
To keep track of the main table and its subgraphs, we’ll create a separate table, subgraph_directory, which acts as a dictionary:

create_subgraph_directory.sql
sql
Show inline
subgraph_id: Matches the subgraph_id in the knowledge_base table.
name and description: Provide metadata for each subgraph, making it easier to manage them.
Step 3: Unified Search Strategy
The current search strategy uses operations based on label, name, property values (key:value), and LTREE operators (* and @). To extend this to include subgraphs, we’ll:

Keep all data in a single table for simplicity and query efficiency.
Use a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) to traverse the graph, following both tree hierarchies within subgraphs and links between them.
Updated Search Operations
Existing Operations:
label: Filter by node label (e.g., WHERE label = 'some_label').
name: Filter by node name (e.g., WHERE name = 'some_name').
key:value: Filter by property value (e.g., WHERE properties->>'key' = 'value').
LTREE *: Pattern matching for descendants (e.g., WHERE path ~ 'root.a.*').
LTREE @: Ancestor/descendant checks (e.g., WHERE 'root.a' @> path for descendants).
New Operations:
Traverse Subgraphs: A recursive traversal that follows linked_subgraph_id to jump between subgraphs.
Scope Control: Option to limit search to a single subgraph or include all linked subgraphs.
Example: Full Graph Traversal
To search across the entire graph starting from a node, including subgraphs:

graph_traversal.sql
sql
Show inline
How It Works:
Starts at a given node.
Recursively finds:
Direct children in the same subgraph (path ~ (g.path || '.*{1}') limits to immediate children).
The root of any linked subgraph (subgraph_id = g.linked_subgraph_id AND path = 'root').
Returns all reachable nodes.
Example: Property Search Across Subgraphs
To find nodes with a specific property value across all subgraphs:

sql



SELECT * FROM knowledge_base.knowledge_base
WHERE properties->>'key' = 'value';
This works seamlessly since all data is in one table.

Example: Descendants Within a Subgraph
To find descendants of a node within its own subgraph:

sql



SELECT * FROM knowledge_base.knowledge_base
WHERE subgraph_id = 0 AND 'root.a' @> path;
Summary
Table Structure: Added subgraph_id and linked_subgraph_id to knowledge_base.knowledge_base.
Dictionary: subgraph_directory tracks all subgraphs.
Search Strategy: Extended with recursive CTEs to traverse subgraphs, preserving existing operations and adding cross-subgraph traversal.
This solution maintains the tree hierarchy using LTREE within each subgraph and connects them into a unified graph via linked_subgraph_id, meeting all your requirements efficiently.
